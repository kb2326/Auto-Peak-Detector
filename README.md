# Auto-Peak-Detector
This tool was designed to replicate what researchers already do manually — identify the meaningful part of the PFAS destruction curve (where the signal rises and falls) — and do it automatically and consistently.

Scientific Interpretation:
The AUC represents the total amount of gas detected (e.g., CO₂ at mass 44.00) during PFAS breakdown.

It captures both the intensity of the signal and how long it lasted.

This value is proportional to how much PFAS was destroyed in that run, assuming mass 44.00 directly reflects PFAS decomposition.

Think of it like this:
If the intensity was high for a short time, or low for a long time, both contribute to the same area — total exposure or total gas release over time.
